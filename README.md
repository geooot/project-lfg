This was a school project in which we created an original app of our own idea in what is essentially 23 hours of work (spread out across like 4 weeks).

The idea of the app was to create a matchmaking system that connected gamers with other gamers who are "looking for group" (LFG). So anyone can make a post looking for a group of people in which others can see and join said group.

Were we successfull? Not really...
